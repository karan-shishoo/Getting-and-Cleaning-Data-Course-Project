# Codebook

This codebook outlines the various variables that are present in the tidydata.txt dataset

## Identifiers and Descriptions

subject_Id 		: the subject id to differentiate between subjects

activity_type 	: the type of activity being performed

## Variables remaining

The data set has been cleaned such that only those variables that pertain to means or standard deviation remain.

This has been done so that the minimum data needed to build a general idea of the distribution data remains cutting down on a lot of unnecessary data
